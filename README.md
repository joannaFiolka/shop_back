## About the Project
I have made a modern ecommerce project with react, nodeJS and express.js of an online shop. In this application You can create new account, log-in, add products to application cart and change the amount of them. It is responsive and I have added pagination. The backend is prepared to create an admin profile to administrate orders, add or delete products to sell.
I think it is a good starting point, to develop it in accordance with  the client's guidelines. It is very universal so it can be easy to mach with even very  complex expectations of niche branch of  trade.
